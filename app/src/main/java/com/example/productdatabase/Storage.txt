UNDERSTOOD SO FAR:
Activities are generated by:
1. Editing AndroidManifest to include them
2. Editing .xml file to have the correct context
3. Initializing an Intent and transferring from one activity to another
4. Activity lifecycle: https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle

Classes might have issues if they are in the same file
(i.e. they don't like being public on level 0 in .java named different to their name)
